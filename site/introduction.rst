Introduction
============

I am your host *Martin P. Hellwig* and this site is part of collective 
containing a youtube_ channel,  `g+`_ page and a repository_.

The central theme of this collection is the broader aspects of self sufficiency,
which includes topics such as growing/raising sustenance, service grid 
independency, wilderness skills and preparedness.

As this is new for me, my perspective is largely on learning, teaching and the 
application of modern technology.

Where possible, please feel free to comment, like and dislike, this will help me
improve my material. 


Thank you for your interest,
Yours truly,

Martin
