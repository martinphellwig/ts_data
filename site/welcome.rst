Welcome
=======

I am your host *Martin P. Hellwig* and this site is about documenting my 
experiences as I travel down the road towards self sufficiency.


What is this?
-------------
This site contains articles_ I have written on the subject of self sufficiency.
Also please have a look at the accompanying youtube_ channel, `g+`_ page and 
repository_.

The intention is to have the `g+`_ page as an interactive type of thing and 
youtube_ channel just for the videos. The repository_ is there to store things 
like articles in a `simple text form`_, which is my preferred way of writing 
documents.


Why all google?
---------------
Being an IT consultant, I actually considered on which platform I would like to 
build this, in the end I decided on a google site, a youtube channel and a g+ 
page, in the hope that Google in the future may integrate these more closely as
they already have done with g+ and youtube (not that I think they have done it 
particular well).

My main reason for having a `g+`_ page is so that I can use that as the basis of 
a new channel, so I can post my public stuff there and my private stuff under my 
own name. However a `g+`_ page is more like a post board and it makes it 
difficult to have a more rigid structure for articles, which is the reason I 
also create a google site.

Yes I could have bought a cheap domain myself, throw in a LAMP stack or some 
Django stuff and roll it out all myself, true, that is what I mostly do in my 
day job, but this is not about IT or my career and thus I opted for what is 
cheap, cheerfully and still functional. And for that you can't beat Google as 
the price you pay is having no online privacy at all, which makes it in monetary
sense very cheap (also another reason why I have created a separate page and 
channel).


What is my experience?
----------------------
Self Sufficiency wise, at the time of this writing (10-02-2014) absolutely none, 
maybe even less then that as the house we (my wonderful wife and son) are 
renting in lovely Oxford (that is England, GB, UK) is on the end of the contract
and we are considering buying in the West-Midlands area. Which of course 
requires a mortgage and a deposit, which I don't have at the moment because all
saving are spend on absolute critical essentials like a Land Rover Defender 110.
However we will move back to the Midlands first, the cheaper living will allow 
us to quickly save up for a deposit and then it is just waiting for the right 
property.


So this will be like all from the very beginning thingy?
--------------------------------------------------------
Yes absolutely, also my main motivation to get this thing started so early on, 
is so that it makes it more likely when the ball really starts to roll I can 
keep up with it as everything is more or less already set in place. 


But why?
--------
I like to document things, so this is like a 'Dear Diary' type of effort and 
maybe somebody else can learn (or at least laugh) from my mistakes.


Okay what about the self sufficiency theme?
-------------------------------------------
For various reasons I find this important (I'll document it properly in a 
separate article), but for now it is sufficient to say that I like the idea of 
prepping, bush craft, small holdings and off-grid living. But I am also very 
much tied into the modern western conveniences, which makes off-grid nearly 
impossible. I have no experience at all with animals or growing food, so a small
holding is not a very good idea at the moment. The most bush craft I was 
exposed to was an initial survival training. Although I have a military 
background, I have absolutely no interest at all in the para-military 
aspect of what some people are associated with, I believe strongly that the UK
government is generically speaking there for the common good. I have sufficient 
trust in the Legal System, the Police and the Armed Forces to feel save enough 
to bring my son up in this country. However I also know that our system is being
stretched and due to that avoidable disasters are not avoided and emergencies 
have long response times.

I believe that being a good citizen means being able to help yourself so that 
our government can help those that really need it. Being able to help yourself 
is exactly what self sufficiency is about.


Any other things?
