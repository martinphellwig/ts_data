<div>I am your host <i>Martin P. Hellwig</i> and this site is about documenting my experiences as I travel down the road towards self-sufficiency.<br>
<br>
</div>
<div><b>What is this?</b><br>
</div>
This page is the 'start' page and this site will contain the static content such as <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/towardsselfsufficiency/articles">articles</a> and links such as the accompanying&nbsp; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvrw4X08Btb9HcJTtswsXwQ" target="_blank">youtube channel</a>, the <a href="https://plus.google.com/102773990275477944229" rel="publisher">Google+</a> page and the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/towards_self_sufficiency/data/src">repository</a>. The intention is to have the g+ page as an interactive type of thing and youtube channel just for the videos. The repository is there to store things like articles in their raw text form, which is my preferred way of writing documents.<br>
</div>

<div><b>Why all google?</b><br>
</div>
Being an IT consultant, I actually considered on which platform I would like to build this, in the end I decided on a google site, a youtube channel and a g+ page, in the hope that Google in the future may integrate these more closely as they already have done with g+ and youtube (not that I think they have done it particular well).<br>
</div>
<div>My main reason for having a g+ page is so that I can use that as the basis of a new channel, so I can post my public stuff there and my private stuff under my own name. However a g+ page is more like a post board and it makes it difficult to have a more rigid structure for articles, which is the reason I also create a google site.<br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
Yes I could have bought a cheap domain myself, throw in a LAMP stack or some Django stuff and roll it out all myself, true, that is what I mostly do in my day job, but this is not about IT or my career and thus I opted for what is cheap, cheerfully and still functional. And for that you can't beat Google as the price you pay is having no online privacy at all, which makes it in monetary sense very cheap (also another reason why I have created a separate page and channel).<br>
<br>
</div>
<div><b>What is my experience?</b><br>
</div>
<div>Self Sufficiency wise, at the time of this writing (10-02-2014) absolutely none, maybe even less then that as the house we (my wonderful wife and son) are renting in lovely Oxford (that is England, GB, UK) is on the end of the contract and we are considering buying in the West-Midlands area. Which of course requires a mortgage and a deposit, which I don't have at the moment because all saving are spend on absolute critical essentials like a Land Rover Defender 110. However we will move back to the Midlands first, the cheaper living will allow us to quickly save up for a deposit&nbsp; and then it is just waiting for the right property.<br>
<br>
</div>
<div><b>So this will be like all from the very beginning thingy?<br>
</b></div>
<div>Yes absolutely, also my main motivation to get this thing started so early on, is so that it makes it more likely when the ball really starts to roll I can keep up with it as everything is more or less already set in place. <br>
<br>
</div>
<div><b>But why?</b><br>
</div>
<div>I like to document things, so this is like a 'Dear Diary' type of effort and maybe somebody else can learn (or at least laugh) from my mistakes.<br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><b>Okay what about the self sufficiency theme?</b><br>
</div>
<div>For various reasons I find this important (I'll document it properly in a separate article), but for now it is sufficient to say that I like the idea of prepping, bush craft, small holdings and off-grid living. But I am also very much tied into the modern western conveniences, which makes off-grid nearly impossible. I have no experience at all with animals or growing food, so a small holding is not a very good idea at the moment.&nbsp; The most bush craft I was exposed to was an initial survival training. Although I have a military background,&nbsp; I have absolutely no interest at all in the para-military aspect of what some preppers are associated with, I believe strongly that the UK government is generically speaking there for the common good. I have sufficient trust in the Legal System, the Police and the Armed Forces to feel save enough to bring my son up in this country. However I also know that our system is being stretched and due to that avoidable disasters are not avoided and emergencies have long response times.<br>
<br>
</div>
<div>I believe that being a good citizen means being able to help yourself so that our government can help those that really need it.<br>
Being able to help yourself is exactly what self sufficiency is about.<br>
