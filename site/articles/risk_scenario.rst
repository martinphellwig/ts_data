=============
Risk Scenario
=============

Temporary disruption to infrastructure and unavailability of public utilities.
==============================================================================

Primary Causes
--------------
 - Storm and Floods

Contributing Factors
--------------------
 - Insufficient maintenance of infrastructure by utility companies
 - Insufficient risk management by local governments
 - National governments escalations protocols insufficient

Length
------
 - 3 to 90 days, median 14 days

Statistical Occurrence
----------------------
 - On average once every three years [1]_ locations near rivers and sea most 
   vulnerable [2]_.

Projected infrastructure damages
--------------------------------
 - Underground pipes
 - Overland wiring
 - Road
 - Rail

Projected public utilities disruptions
--------------------------------------
 - Electricity
 - Water
 - Gas
 - Sewage

Unavailability of other essential goods due to primary disruptions
------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Refined Fuels; Paraffin, Petrol, Coal etc.
 - Food and Food Supplements
 - Clothing
 - Medication
 - Personal Hygiene Products

Risks
-----
When a large part of the local population is confronted with unavailability of 
water, food and heated shelter, it is likely that a part of that population will
scavenge for these essentials. This will lead to an overload to the emergency 
services which can not control the situation via conventional means. Between the
time it takes for the national government to react to the escalation it is 
likely that there is an increase of pillage and grievous bodily harm.

Note that this risk scenario has no precedence and is only projected from the 
possibility of multiple disruptions taken place over a prolonged period.

   time between events of 35 months (just a tad under every 3 years).
